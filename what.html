		<div class="text"><h2>Overview</h2><p>Neural networks are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. Mimicking the human brain, neural networks utilize neurons and nodes to process input into output. </p></div>

		<div class="text"><p>The human brain has neurons and synapses that can activate and send signals to each other to process information. Neural networks are loosely modelled after this. In a neural network, there are layers of interconnected nodes that use algorithms and mathematical calculations to map input to output. Deep learning is known as a universal approximator due to this. They are also designed to recognize patterns and can adapt from their mistakes.</p></div>
